# Cosmos TV Show Themed Guessing Game

## What is this?
A guessing game similar to Hangman (minus the drawing depicting a hanging man), where a player guesses a Cosmos themed word letter by letter until they either run out of guesses or complete the word.
## How does it work?
- Uses the Global Event Handlers `onkeyup`  to capture the player's letter guess as they release said key on their keyboard, and `onclick` property to signal mouse events.
	
- Uses the DOM method `querySelector()` to find HTML elements, and  `innerHTML` to get and/or set the HTML within the specified element to keep the player updated with the game's progression.

- Uses OOP, and so has all of the game code (except for key and mouse events) is organized in one object with several methods, which are called with the key and/or mouse events.
